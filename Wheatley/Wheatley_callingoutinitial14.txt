Pick me up. Let's get out of here.
Pick--would you pick me up?
[laugh] Would you pick me up?
Hey! Pick me up!
Pick me up, don't forget to pick me up!
Might want to just pick me up.
Oh! Oh! Don't leave me behind! Do pick me up, if you would...
Just, ah... pick me up. Take me with you.
Ohhh. Remember when you picked me up? Five seconds ago! Ohhh, that was amazing! Do it again, pick me up again!
Let's do it again! Pick me up again!
