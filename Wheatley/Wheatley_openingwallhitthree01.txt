Whew. There we go! Now I'll be honest, you are probably in no fit state to run this particular type of cognitive gauntlet. But... um... at least you're a good jumper. So... you've got that. You've got the jumping on your side. Just do your best, and I'll meet you up ahead.
Alright, off you go!
Go on. Just... March on through that hole.
Yeah, it's alright. Go ahead.
I know I've painted quite a grim picture of your chances. But if you simply stand here, we will both surely die.
So, once again, just... move along. One small step and everything.
Go on.
On ya go.
Your destination's probably not going to come meet us here. Is it? So go on.
