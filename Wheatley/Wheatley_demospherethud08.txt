I can't move, though. That's the problem now.
Are you still there? Can you pick me up, do you think? If you are there?
Hello? Can you--can you pick me up, please?
Sorry, are you still there? Could you--could you pick me up?
If you ARE there, would you mind... giving me a little bit of help? [nervous laugh] Just picking me up.
Look down. Where am I? Where am I?
On the floor. Needing your help. The whole time. All the time. Needing your help.
Still here on the floor. Waiting to be picked up. Um.
Look down. Who's that, down there, talking? It's me! Down on the floor. Needing you to pick me up.
I spy with my little eye, something that starts with 'f'.
Do you give up? It was the floor. Lying down on the floor. Is where I am. Needing you to pick me up.
Don't want to hassle you. Sure you're busy. But--still here on the floor. Waiting to be picked up.
Now I spy something that starts with an 'a'.
Give up? Also the floor. Was the answer that time. Same as before. Still on the floor.
What are you doing, are you just having a little five minutes to yourself? Fair enough. You've had a rough time. You've been asleep for who knows how long. You've got the massive brain damage. And you're having a little rest. But NOW. Get yourself up. And pick me up.
