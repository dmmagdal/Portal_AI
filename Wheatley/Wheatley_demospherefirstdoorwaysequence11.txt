Seriously, I'm not joking. Could you just turn around for a second?
I can't... I can't do it if you're watching. [nervous laugh]
I can't do it if you're watching. If you.... just turn around?
What's that behind you? It's only a robot on a bloody stick! A different one!
Alright. [nervous laugh] Can't do it if you're leering at me. Creepy.
Okay. Listen. I can't do it with you watching. I know it seems pathetic, given what we've been through. But just turn around. Please?
