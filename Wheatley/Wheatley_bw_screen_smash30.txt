Yes... just... wanted to point out... it's not like I've got hordes of replacement monitors just lying around back here in the old warehouse that I can just wheel out and bolt back on. I didn't order in loads of spare monitors thinking some crazy woman was going to go around smashing them all. Sorry if that's my fault. Sorry if I didn't have the forethought to think oh she might go crazy one day and just smash all the monitors instead of just getting on with things. Sorry I didn't think of that.
