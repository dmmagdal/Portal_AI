Look how small you are down there! I can barely see you! Very tiny and insignificant! Wait. Just thought of something? How am I going to get in? You know, being bloody massive and everything. Wait! I know! You get into the lift, okay? Then I'll eject myself out of my new body into the lift just as you pass by me! Brilliant. It's perfect. Except for all the glass hitting us when I smash through the lift, that's a bit of a problem. Also, once I eject myself out of the core the lift might stop. Then we'd be trapped in a lift full of broken glass suspended fifty feet off the ground. You know what? Just get in the lift. We'll iron out the details as we go. Go on. Get in. Get in the lift. The escape lift. Just there. Come on. The one you risked your life to get to. So you could escape certain death. No rush. It's the lift just there. The thing that looks like a lift. That's what you're looking for. It is confusing, I know. It'll be fine. Get in.
