Jump! Actually, looking at it, that is quite a distance, isn't it?"

"You know what? Go ahead and jump. You've got braces on your legs. No braces on your arms, though. Gonna have to rely on the old human strength to keep a grip on the device and, by extension, me. So do. Do make sure to maintain a grip."

"Also, a note: No braces on your spine, either. So don't land on that.  Or your head, no braces there. That could split like a melon from this height. [nervous chuckle] Do definitely focus on landing with your legs."

"Quick question: Have you been working out? Because there's no evidence of it. I'm not a plastic cup. We will be landing with some force. So a bit of grip. Just using grip. Classic grip."

"So go ahead and jump. What's the worst that could happen? Oh. Oh wait, I just now thought of the worst thing. Oh! I just thought of something even worse. Alright. New, better plan: no imagining of any potential outcomes whatsoever. Just jump, into the abyss, there, and let's see what happens.
