# Portal_AI

### Description:

This public repository is for anyone that's a fan of programming, 
machine learning, and the Portal series. Users can download this 
repository and use language models from HuggingFace Transformers and
Happy Transformer to generate text similar to the voice lines from
Portal. This can be applied to characters such as GLaDOS and Wheatley 
as well as The Announcer, the Turrets, the Personality Cores, and Cave 
Johnson.

This is NOT a conversational chatbot. While these texts were trained
off of the original voice lines from the games, all the conversations
from Portal are one sided and rely on situational context.

### Setup

Make sure to have Python 3 installed as well as Tensorflow 2 and 
Pytorch. Then run the following command to install the necessary 
modules:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Docker
